# Experimenting Node.js with Treehouse API

This was my first contact with Node.js. In this exercise I've learned to:
- Write a command line application in Node.js
- Talk to an API using Node.js
- Handle errors with try and catch

How to test:
-
Simply run app.js on your command line passing valid treehouse profile usernames. Ex:

$ node app.js chalkers davemcfarland
